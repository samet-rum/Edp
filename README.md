# Library Event-Driven Programming (EDP) System

This project demonstrates an Event-Driven Programming (EDP) system for a library management application. It includes interactions between users, library administrators, and event handlers, showcasing a real-world use case of EDP.

## Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses events for user actions (e.g., borrowing or returning books).
- **Modular Design**: Organized into separate modules like events, handlers, and user actions.
- **Scalable**: Easily extendable with new event types or handlers.
- **Interactive**: Allows user interaction through a command-line interface.
